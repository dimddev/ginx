1. Introduction

Hello everybody, I'm Dimitar and this time in "Show the Thing" I will represent something different.
This time we will talking about Math Graphs. Math graphs are discovered by Leonhard Euler
on the Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg in earlier 17th century. Nowdays graphs are widely used mostly everywhere,
from medecine to astro phisics. Math Graphs are not the usual graphs or chart as chart pie or bar chart,
they looks, more likely as tree or a structure represented by nodes connected via edges.

So what make graphs so interested to us and HeleCloud will be explained a bit later in the next topic.

2. Graphs meet HeleCloud

As company, HeleCloud could be represented as social network and thanks to the graphs we can make a really intersting,
observation, how exactly this social network, let's count few important bullets here:

2.1. How communications happen, what is the flow of information?
2.2. How strong are connected all nodes to each other in this social network?
2.3. What is minimum numbers of nodes need to be removed, to break this social network
2.4. The center and the periphery of the network
2.5. The most valueble node in the network - triangles, centrality
2.6. Is there a communities in this netowrk?
2.7. Find the shortestpaths between nodes - tasks, skills, information, projects, etc.

3. GinX - A Graph Inspector X, it's a command line tool for dealing with math graphs.
